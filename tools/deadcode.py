"""deadcode.py - static dead-symbol detector for Vordr's MASM sources.

Replaces the manual dead-symbol sweeps from the code-cleanup audits with a
repeatable tool.  It reads every src/*.asm file, collects the symbols each one
*defines* (procs, data labels, and equ/textequ constants), then pools every
identifier *referenced* anywhere across all sources.  A defined symbol whose
name never appears as a reference is dead code.

Why source, not obj/*.lst: build.cmd does not clean obj/, so stale listings
from deleted modules (bloom.lst, csvimport.lst, ...) linger there and would
produce phantom results.  The sources are the ground truth and need no build.

References are pooled across ALL files, so a proc defined in one module and
called from another counts as live.  A symbol used only through a macro still
appears - Vordr's macros (WINCALL, WSTR, CALL_GUARDED, ...) take the symbol
name as a literal argument, so the name token is present in the source text.

Categories: proc | data | equ | macro.  --only <cat> narrows the report.
Exit code = number of dead symbols found (minus the allowlist), so
"build strict" can gate on it.  Usage:
    python tools\\deadcode.py [--src DIR] [--only proc|data|equ|macro] [-v]
